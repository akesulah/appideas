i3 = Idea.create name:"Stoppi (This is an idea, not an actual project that has been coded yet)", desc:"Stoppi is a 2019 way to stop the bus!

Seeing which bus is about to arrive at the bus-stop one is standing at is compromised by the arctic darkness and hash weateher conditions such as autumn rain or sleet storms that are very common in Finland.

With Stoppi -mobile app a user can see which busses are about to arrive and he can signal the bus to stop a long beforehand. Thanks to the app the bus driver will be informed that passangers are waiting to be picked up at a specific bus stop. This allows avoiding late signaling (hand-waving) at the bus stop and dangers of emergency braking due to the driver not recognizing the passanger that is waiting at the bus stop.

There is also another benefit of using the Stoppi app. The app recognizes that a passanger has entered a bus and therefore he can browse which stops are next on the drive. This facilitates getting off the buss in a new environment where the passanger doesn't quite know where to get off. E.g. the motorway, the bus stops are 
all alike.

Unfortunately it is not currently possible to implement the whole app because of the limitedness of soft- and hardware inside busses. But maybe a compromised version of the app would be possible to develop?

Establishing a (money) gambling site (e.g. poker) is illegal in Finland because of a monopoly of Raha-automaattiyhdistys (RAY) exists. And this is due the finnish law, no way around it.

However, since Bitcoin is not officially a currency, one could establish a bitoin-based gambling site would be possible. Ta-da."
